# CSES Problem Set Solutions (Python)

This repository contains my solutions to the CSES Problem Set, implemented in **Python** üêç.

### üìå About
The [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/) is a great collection of competitive programming problems. I‚Äôm solving these problems in Python, and uploading them here so others can use them for learning or reference.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
Some of these solutions **may not be accepted** on CSES if submitted in Python due to:
- Tighter time constraints for Python
- Differences in execution speed compared to C++

In such cases, the same logic will usually pass in **C++** with minor or no modifications.

### ‚úÖ Usage
Feel free to use these solutions to:
- Understand problem-solving approaches
- Compare logic between Python and C++
- Practice and improve your own code

Happy Coding! üöÄ
